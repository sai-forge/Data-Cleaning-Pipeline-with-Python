# Data Cleaning Pipeline with Python

A modular and reusable data cleaning pipeline built using Python and pandas. This project streamlines the preprocessing of raw datasets by automating essential cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, and detecting outliers. It's ideal for data analysts, data scientists, and engineers seeking to expedite the data preparation phase of their workflows.

##  Features

* **Handle Missing Values**: Automatically detect and manage missing data through imputation or removal.
* **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and eliminate duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
* **Correct Data Types**: Convert columns to appropriate data types for accurate analysis.
* **Standardize Column Names**: Normalize column headers for consistency and readability.
* **Outlier Detection**: Identify and address outliers using statistical methods like Z-score.
* **Customizable Pipeline**: Modular functions allow for easy customization and extension.

##  Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sai-forge/Data-Cleaning-Pipeline-with-Python.git
   cd Data-Cleaning-Pipeline-with-Python
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

##  Usage

1. **Import the Pipeline Module**:

   ```python
   from data_cleaning_pipeline import DataCleaningPipeline
   ```

2. **Initialize the Pipeline with Your Dataset**:

   ```python
   pipeline = DataCleaningPipeline('path_to_your_dataset.csv')
   ```

3. **Execute the Cleaning Process**:

   ```python
   cleaned_data = pipeline.run()
   ```

4. **Save the Cleaned Dataset**:

   ```python
   cleaned_data.to_csv('cleaned_dataset.csv', index=False)
   ```

##  Example

Here's a brief example of how to use the pipeline:

```python
from data_cleaning_pipeline import DataCleaningPipeline

# Initialize the pipeline with the dataset
pipeline = DataCleaningPipeline('raw_data.csv')

# Run the cleaning process
cleaned_df = pipeline.run()

# Save the cleaned data
cleaned_df.to_csv('cleaned_data.csv', index=False)
```
